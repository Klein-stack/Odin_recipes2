Hello Guys! THis is the first project that I've created with the help of The Odin Project using html and it marks my first step towards web development.
THis websites present recipes of dishes favourite to Odin.
It has been purely made using html so it won't be aesthetically pleasing for the time being but soon it would be decent. So stay tuned and watch me grow. 
Thank you!
